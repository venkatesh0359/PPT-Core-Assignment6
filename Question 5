Differentiate between List and Set in Java.

List:

Ordered: List maintains the order of elements based on their insertion.
Duplicates: List allows duplicate elements; the same element can appear multiple times in a list.
Index-based access: List elements can be accessed using their index (position) in the list.
Implementations: Common implementations of List are ArrayList (dynamic array) and LinkedList (doubly linked list).
Set:

Unordered: Set does not maintain the order of elements; they are stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval.
No duplicates: Set does not allow duplicate elements; each element is unique in a set.
No index-based access: Set does not provide index-based access since it does not maintain the order.
Implementations: Common implementations of Set are HashSet (uses hash table) and TreeSet (stores elements in a sorted tree structure).
