Explain the various interfaces used in the Collection framework.

The Collection framework in Java includes several interfaces, some of which are:
Collection: The root interface that defines basic operations like add, remove, contains, etc., for a generic collection of objects.

List: An ordered collection (also known as a sequence) that allows duplicate elements. It provides positional access and supports methods like get, set, add, remove, etc.

Set: A collection that does not allow duplicate elements. It models the mathematical set abstraction and provides methods to add, remove, and check for element existence.

Queue: A collection used to hold elements before processing. It follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order.

Map: An object that maps keys to values. It does not extend the Collection interface but is an essential part of the Collections Framework. It does not allow duplicate keys.

SortedSet: A Set that maintains elements in sorted order.

SortedMap: A Map that maintains keys in sorted order.

Deque: A double-ended queue that allows insertion and removal from both ends.
